#Experiment 2: Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures in Java

##Aim  
To implement Java programs using classes, methods, static members, stack, queue, and string operations.

##Programs Included  
1.Area of rectangle using class and methods  
2.Demonstration of static variables, static blocks, and static methods  
3.Stack and Queue implementation using arrays  
4.Sorting 10 names in alphabetical order  

##Tools Used  
-Java  
-JDK  
-VS Code  
-Command Line  

##Learning Outcome  
- Learned creation of classes and objects  
- Understood and used static variables, static blocks, and static methods  
- Implemented stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) using arrays  
- Learned to take user input using Scanner  
- Learned to sort strings alphabetically
