## Experiment no: 3
Implementation of Different Types of Inheritance in Java

---

## 🎯 Aim
To implement given problem statements demonstrating different types of inheritance concepts in Java.

---

## 💻 Programs Included

### ✅ 1. BankAccount and SavingsAccount (Method Overriding)
- Created a base class `BankAccount`
- Methods:
  - deposit()
  - withdraw()
- Created subclass `SavingsAccount`
- Overrides withdraw() to maintain minimum balance of 100.

  
Concept Used: Single Inheritance, Method Overriding

---

### ✅ 2. Employee Class Hierarchy
- Base class: Employee
- Subclasses:
  - Manager
  - Developer
  - Programmer
- Methods implemented:
  - Bonus calculation
  - Performance report generation
  - Project management

 
Concept Used: Hierarchical Inheritance

---

### ✅ 3. Abstract Shape Class (Rectangle & Triangle)
- Abstract class Shape with:
  - dim1 and dim2 variables
  - abstract area() method
- Subclasses:
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle
- Calculates area of shapes.


Concept Used: Abstraction, Inheritance

### ✅ 4. Multilevel Inheritance (Student → Test → Result)
- Class hierarchy:
  Student → Test → Result
- Features:
  - Stores roll number
  - Stores subject marks
  - Calculates total result

Concept Used: Multilevel Inheritance
