# Experiment 4: Interfaces and Inheritance in Java

## Aim

To implement Java programs using interfaces, inheritance, and abstract methods to understand object-oriented programming concepts.

## Programs Included

1. Stack operations using interface (push, pop, display, overflow, underflow)
2. Shape interface implementation using Rectangle and Triangle to calculate area
3. Student exam result system using inheritance and interface

## Tools Used

* Java
* JDK
* VS Code
* Command Line

## Learning Outcome

* Learned implementation of interfaces in Java
* Understood inheritance and code reusability
* Implemented stack operations using interface
* Implemented abstract methods in multiple classes
* Learned multiple inheritance using interface
* Understood hierarchical class structure in Java
